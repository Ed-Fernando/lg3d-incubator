    <p>
      This is a canned <em>proof-of-concept</em> demo that attempts to give
      viewers a taste of what James Burke's vision is regarding the Knowledege
      Web and how it might be used as an educational tool in high-school
      classrooms.   
    </p>
    <p>
      This first demo was thrown together without much planning or design.  This
      is because am unfamiliar with Java3D and LookingGlass so I didn't really
      know what I could or could not do.  Anyway, I'm using this first demo as
      a Java3D/LookingGlass study exercise and plan to throw it away and do it
      better in the second demo, <code>kwebdemo2</code>, on a completely
      separate source tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demo is intentionally very canned with very little <em>real</em> user
      control or interaction.  A lot of this is due to the limited time and
      resources currently available on this project. The hope is that this will
      generate interest in the project once others see what we are attempting to
      achieve. See our
      <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javadesktop/KWeb" target="_blank">
      wiki</a> page for ways to get involved.
