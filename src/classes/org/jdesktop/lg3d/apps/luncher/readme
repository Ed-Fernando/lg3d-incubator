The Luncher objects is a simulator of the GlassyTaskbar object and is used
to demonstrate how a Star Menu system could be integrated in lg3d.

I am trying two ideas: The first idea is that a menu is a 3 dimension stack
of cards (GlassyPanel objects) you can chouse from. You activate the menu by
clicking on the Menu icon and deactivate it with a second click. The stack
can be turned by using button 3 on the mouse and each card can be moved by
dragging it, using mouse button1. You chouse a new menu by clicking on a card,
the result is that the icons on the taskbar will change to present the menu.
The Luncher1 object simulate this.
The second idea, is a Cube Menu as suggested on the 3DStartMenu Wiki page for 
the lg3d project. The menu is presented by a cube where each side is a menu
point. You can turn the cube by using mouse button 3.
The Luncher2 object simulate this menu. I have also tried to integreate the
Cube menu in the task bar, see below.

To see how it functions you have to copy the MenuConfigFile.xml file to the
etc/lg3d directory and the GlassyCardIcon.png file to the resources/images/icon
directory. To actual lunch the Luncher1 or Luncher2 you have to change the
GlassyTaskbar, see the source around line 90.

File and object explanation:

MyTextPanel:
 This object is a copy of the TextPanel, with a more dark text color. It would
 be nice if this was a property of the TextPanel together with the text font.

MouseDraggedButtonEventAdapter:
 This object does almost the same thing as the MouseDraggedEventAdapter, only
 it is mouse button sensitive. These two objects could easy be merged.

GlassyCardMenu:
 This object is the actual Start Menu using the card stack idea.

GlassyCubeMenu:
 This object is the actual Start Menu using the cube idea.

MenuConfigFileReader:
 This object can read a XML configuration file for the Menu object.

GlassyCardMenuHolder:
 The parent node of the GlassyCardMenu object should implement the
 GlassyCardMenuHolder interface so the GlassyCardMenu can change its icons.

GlassyCardIcon.png
 Is an icon used by the GlassyCardMenu object. It should exits in the
 resources/images/icon directory.

MenuConfigFile.xml
 Is a XML configuration file for the GlassyCardMenu. The file is used to define
 shortcuts and belonging icons for the GlassyCardMenu. Take a look it is not
 difficult to understand.

GlassyTaskbar:
 Is a copy of the org.jdesktop.lg3d.scenemanager.utils.taskbar.GlassyTaskbar
 object where the GlassyCubeMenu is integrated. Copy it over the existing java
 file and the Taskbar has a menu system read from a configuration file.
