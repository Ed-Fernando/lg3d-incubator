3D Mascot
Do we have a 3D mascot I can use for my project. Whenever a user is entering command in natural language I want to show the mascot speaking the command, possibly animating as well. This is quite similar to searching in windows XP. So if someone can guide me, it will make life easier.

Thanks,
Harsh
