PingPong is a little application displaying a table tennis table. The ball
is flying back and forth as two virtual players are playing with each other.

A German intro to LG3D including the development of this application can be
found at
  http://www.pl-berichte.de/berichte/LG3D-Tutorial/LG3D-Tutorial.html

To compile simply use
  javac PingPong.java
Probably you have to setup some environment variables before like
  export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.5.0/
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
  export CLASSPATH=/home/[username]/lg3d/lib/ext/lg3d-core.jar
