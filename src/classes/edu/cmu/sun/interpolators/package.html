Interpolators between set values that assist with Animation and curve shape creation.

Half of this package describes a SimpleMotionAnimation object which provides linear interpolations during an animation within looking glass.  The other half of this package is some skeleton interpolators to do a very basic ease-in ease-out interpolation and is used for curve-drawing in our system.  We wrote the classes for curve generation because we thought we were going to do a lot more curve drawing.  Unfortunately, we ran out of time, and they are only used to draw the Fold geometry in the system.
