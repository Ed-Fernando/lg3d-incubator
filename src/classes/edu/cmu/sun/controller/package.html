The controller package is responsible for handling user actions. 
Typically, a View component will pick up the event, and map that 
event to an action in a controller.  The controller will then modify 
the Models as necessary to perform the user's requested action.  
Then, the controller will trigger the TransitionManager to update all of the views again.
