<H3 CLASS="western">Introduction</H3>
<P CLASS="list-western">Contact3D, Chart3D, and Prefuse3D are demo
programs written with the <A HREF="http://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/">Project
Looking Glass</A> API to study and demonstrate the following.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="list-western">reusable 3D widgets such as text panels,
	tiptext, buttons, and so forth;</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="list-western">reusable software framework dealing with
	contacts; and lastly,</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="list-western">reusable 3D information visualization.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="list-western">Contact3D is derived from another project at
Sun (<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/software/desktop-collaboration/">Desktop
Collaboration and Communication Project</A>) at Sun.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western">Chart3D and Prefuse3D are 3D organizational
chart tools designed to demonstrate data visualization aspects.
Prefuse3D, as its name suggests, is built on top of the popular open
source <A HREF="http://prefuse.sourceforge.net/">2D Prefuse
visualization library</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western">Since software reusability is an important
goal, all three applications share the same application services
framework, and common widgets where necessary. While all three of
them are fully functioning, they are still work-in-progress, and
hence are not as well organized as they ought to be unfortunately.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western">The files are all under the
org/jdesktop/lg3d/apps/orgchart package. Class diagrams and design
notes will be provided as soon as they are done.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Contact3D</H3>
<P CLASS="list-western">Contact3D initializes its data using 2 files.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western"><CODE CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/src/classes/org/jdesktop/lg3d/apps/orgchart/framework/default.xml</FONT></FONT></CODE>
is used to populate a set of preferences, and is shared with Chart3D.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western">.<FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/src/classes/org/jdesktop/lg3d/apps/orgchart/ui/contact/contacts.xml</FONT></FONT>
is used to read a list of contacts. Read the comments in the file for
modifications.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western">Click on the “Contact3D” icon to launch
Contact3D. Contact3D shows the contacts as panels either on the side
of the screen (first figure), or in the middle (second figure). You
can press “space” to toggle between the two of them. Contact3D
has the following features.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="list-western">It demonstrates presence. If the
	contact's panel is framed in red, it indicates that the contact is
	not off-line. If the panel is framed in green, it indicates the
	contact is on-line. Currently, the presence information is
	randomized fake information.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="list-western">It shows the contact's calendar. To do
	so, you can either click and hold on the contact's panel, or click
	on the bottom left bottom for the panel. This will rotate the panel
	to show the calendar. Currently, this too is fake calendar
	information.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="list-western">You can click on one of the left buttons
	to communicate with the contact. This is meant as a demo, so none of
	the features are enabled.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="list-western">Lastly, the thumbnail of Contact3D provides
for a simplified view of the contact presences.</P>

</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Chart3D</H3>
<P CLASS="list-western">Chart3D uses the same
<CODE CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">src/classes/org/jdesktop/lg3d/apps/orgchart/framework/default.xml</FONT></FONT></CODE>
to populate its data in the interest of code reusability.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western">By default, it uses the LDAP directory to
obtain organizational hierarchy information with a schema used
internally of Sun. You will most likely need to modify the way
managers and direct reports are defined within your organizational
schema. It is also possible to use Java preferences to simulate this
information by using the PreferencesContactService used for
Contact3D. However, some work will need to be done to support that.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western">When you first launch Chart3D, you are first
asked for a starting contact to build the tree. You can then expand
your tree downwards by clicking on a contact, or upwards by clicking
on the up arrow. Chart3D tries to make it easier to distinguish
between managers and non-managers by painting the managers in red. If
the contact has a photo, the photo will be displayed, using the same
schema and algorithm (and code) used in Contact3D.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western"><IMG SRC="chart1.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=365 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Prefuse3D</H3>
<P CLASS="list-western">Prefuse3D is the Prefuse version of Chart3D.
It shares the same underlying framework and mechanisms as Chart3D.
However, the look-and-feel is different because it attempts to use
the Prefuse layouts.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western">Note that this is work-in-progress. We have
chosen Prefuse as a demonstrator for understanding the requirements
of building data visualization into the Project Looking Glass
environment. This is because Prefuse provides for a rich and
generalized API for building such visualizations easily. The Prefuse
library, however, is optimized for Java2D, and hence some of the
constructs are either useless or need to be worked around completely
in the Project Looking Glass. The code has been hacked to display
contacts in an existing radial form, but without the edges.</P>
